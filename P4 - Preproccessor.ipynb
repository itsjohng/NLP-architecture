       "'30   anderson recurrently  anxieties arise around such issues as these  can architecture be other than a mere servant to commercial capitalist ideological forces  each society gets the architecture it deserves  is not autonomous production the only way to avoid submersion in the material conditions of one s time  how can a formally driven enterprise like architecture address social issues responsibly  or at all   in the fall of 1991  i was invited to join what was dominantly a faculty colloquium at harvard s graduate school of design  the event seemed to be an attempt to surface  and perhaps to resolve  competing positions within the ped  agogy of the school  did not an eminent international school of architecture need to conceive and represent itself as concerned with the most fundamental levels of its discipline  should not the school represent to its students an ethi  cal drive to address the social issues that confound the smaller and greater environments in which it finds itself  at that point  it was easy to assert that social commitment in architec  ture could not be found through a vulgar marxism that treats architecture as a mere epiphenomenon fully circumscribed by its infrastructural base  nor could it be in any other form of social determinism that accounts for archi  tecture wholly by forces external to it  still more implausible was an architec  tural determinism in which the physical environment causes social behavior  how could one avoid determinism without finding oneself supporting a view of architecture as autonomous   without  that is  embracing architecture as a game  however beautiful or challenging the game might be  the morning ended inconclusively  with a general anxiety about choosing between social and disciplinary responsibility   the latter exemplified by concepts of auton  omy in architecture  the editors of this issue of per pecta began from a position more conge  nial to me  seeking to examine  architecture s location between autonomous dis  cipline and cultural product   the poles of autonomy and product are present in their formulation and invite the anxieties already noted  b t tiewqowd   bftwe

referenced my article  critical conventionalism in architecture  that opened the first issue of aazemblage in 1986 1 one word from that essay   quasi autonomy   elicits the position to which i shall return here 2 in a polemical world  the exploration of positions away from the poles is often not welcome  refusing to man the battlements at either pole appears  i suppose  wimpy  but our editors have risked entering such a discourse  in the portfolio section of this journal  k  michael hays recalls a time of polarization  around 1970  where he perceived a widespread concern with the instrumental  ization of architecture  a concern that in turn elicited a significant reaction in the search for an autonomous architecture  in an aside  hays noted that the editors  and even he  would not remember that time  with that prod  let me return to an unpublished essay that i presented at the architectural associa  tion in london and again at the ac sa cranbrook meetings of 1966   problem solving and problem worrying  is a period piece to the extent that the problem solving discussion illustrates the temper of the time and the instrumentalization to which hays refers  that overt content of the essay sits recognizably in a more general sense of the malaise of architecture in the 196os  the seeming triumph of architectural modernism in the post war years had by then degenerated to the rootless  decorative stylism of archi  tects like philip johnson  edward durell stone  and minoru yamasaki  those architects and theoreticians who proposed problem solving methods may or may not have troubled with criticism of this degenerative modernism  but their search for a reliable  even scientific  method certainly gained attention through their ambition for an architecture that stemmed from a fundamental process based on empirical information  my alternative of  problem worrying  sought an alternative path  one that was in sympathy with the reciprocities of form and design exemplified in the only american architectural work of that moment that appeared to deserve critical acclaim   the work of louis i  kahn  kahn was as strong in rhetorical persuasion as in architecture  but he was not one to polarize arguments or his discipline  he remains a model for the value of inquiry between the poles  so much for the setting of the 1966 essay 3 in its critique of problem solv  ing  it already engaged the early developments in computation and design  at least some strains of which still seek to instrumentalize our discipline  in any case  the essay dwells on the  between  theme that has been a constant in my thought   and the reason for my participation in perspecta 33  since this histori  cal piece is unpublished  and serves both as witness to a moment and grounds for a continuing position  we include the essay here in abbreviated form  problem solving and problem worrying  1966 4 the notion of problem solving  especially as architects have encoun  tered it  is imbedded in a desire for justification  in stronger instances  there may be a belief that problem solving routines will lead to justi  fiable results  in weaker instances there may be the belief that one s activity can be justified merely through using powerful  if misappropri  ated  techniques  it is imperative that we do not warp human well being just for the sake of exploiting a technique   especially when the technique is a pow  erful one  as i shall argue in more detail  the concepts of problem solv  ing that interest architects involve either problems of achieving definite goals or problems of synthesizing from a body of established facts  due to these characteristics of either definite goal orientation or inductiv  ism  these notions of problem solving are neither descriptive of the tradi  tional behavior of the best architects nor applicable to the current prob  lem situation of architecture  in contrast to  solving the problem   i will present another attitude toward problems   problem worrying   let me attempt to characterize the notion of  problem worrying  with words of a more positive connotation  architecture is concerned with structur  ing our environment to facilitate the achievement of human purposes where the purposes are incompletely known at the outset and cannot be extrapolated from known purposes  indeed  human purpose is altered w ing this approach can be crliticized  then  in at least two ser iolus ways  i se 1  the usual problem of inductivist methods is that they can never be sure the of adequate data from which to synthesize  or even adequate data to   the    heck against  and 2  that the process of creative design is artificially n ce        fd ii order that it may be viewed systematically and its results h situ   justified by their consistency with an initial statement  i6   explicit systematic problem solving design is not  of course  the only pos  t the human sible alternative to the current  easily criticizable situation of architec  tural design  if  then  systematic design is not the only alternative and irises from a is itself open to serious criticism  why should the adoption of these tech  it seems  the niques seem to be imperative  serious criti  our society certainly encourages an enthusiasm for  new tech  ects are inca  niques  but such a compulsion is especially deeply rooted explicitly and cts appear to implicitly   in the thinking of architects  this compulsion stems from t sc  ali     apce an eof the nineteenth century doctrine that architecture is      physicalexpression  and    perhaps the fullest expression  of the spirit  at   gbe t h ettim r  once tius notion is accepted for past times  and once it is i  he b  5rezalied t lve in a different time  the necessity arises to discover b sfchor      tti    tiew jad the form that will express that spirit  such othatac  aid r sarch for irits and expressions can lead to various situations  but it prwblem oe compelling interpretation claims that the architect must express  t   x t tspirri the times through the use of the u newest materials and tech  attaeshi  niques the irony of the topic we are discussing is this  the search for   neve    aspirit of the times is a kind of historical phrenology that distracts iiccommu  one from actual problem situations  yet in our instance the very spirit  r new teche  expressing technique is one of problem solving  prf fronm the it appears that in the 1960s there is a double imperative for the tuteofarchi    use of problem solving techniques  first  because we have what are to study the perceived to be acute problems  and then because the very use of ipessional these techniques is taken to express our times  this combination of  6m will t inductivist and historicist ideas  open to criticism in so many ways  tfero prince  encourages the use of problem solving techniques as an end in itself   eb with a if the problem solving routines should be inadequate to handle the   clanc we complexity of the problem and therefore generate an environment that evelop rnore distorts human purpose  one can interpret the distortion as expressive ring  9p prior  of the times  this inadequacy must be embraced and solace found in semstat ing  knowing that another appropriate step of destiny was fulfilled  under  m solving  the historicist prejudice of modern architectural thought  what results rinetori tro j  y from the use of a new technique is less important than the claim that proposalsq oq use of these means is demanded historically  in such an inflation of solvin a there is the d that there is the danger that a humanly important activity  providing itdefned physical envirn6ment that will facilitate the achievement of human uttieek  dufp  g  puvses  will be artificially and detrimentally simplified in order that it fit xed standard the available techniques  i  a    w    my argumnlt may now be reformulated to say  there is no impera  o  it    that  we must use any given technique  there is  however  an impera  n o  the fact tive that we attempt to better understand architectural activity  the prob  l   wtefthe lem u sirituaton wi tr which it works  and the reasons

attempt to do this throuoh  n o exary  pie and then deducewhat app earfto e s i immediately concerns me is that an important human activity should not be artificially and detrimentally simplified in order to fit an extant mechanical routine  the danger of such an over simplification stems both from the enthusiasm for mechanization and from the impoverished understanding of architecture fostered by modern architectural theory  architects see that any solution  any form  has implications beyond those that were intended  including implications for the reformulation of the original problem or need  consequently  architects are as interested in the form as in the problem  they see a dynamic relation of form and problem as of the fiversality of suc lem that is not sufficie rfi c n   the

that  in its own wo6rds  o do  leges graduate visual illiterates    harvard then decided to conceiyea teaching program that called for active participation in the visualarts  this program required a building  since the involvement was with  he visual arts  the site chosen was near the fogg museum  teaching at the visual arts center has the opportunity to be the most important factor in harvard s program of education in the arts  as a complement to that didactic program  however  le corbusier and his building brilliantly reformulated the original problem  any teaching pro  gram reaches only a small part of a university community  and very few people outside that community  if universities are to be concerned with general artistic illiteracy  they must instruct the entire community  the building itself must reach out and engage every person in such a way that even people who will never be formally enrolled at the visual arts center have the opportunity to achieve new realizations about the poten  tial of architectural form as a shaper of life  i had the memorable expe  rience of observing such a realization  without prior instruction  we brought some mit freshmen to visit the carpenter center  a young woman completely untutored in architecture explored the le corbusier building  after she moved through the building for some time  she timidly explained that when she came to the top of the ramp  she felt herself to be all over the building at once  one could at least begin to analyze the objective qualities of the building that contributed to her reaction  p   4 4     r

esynthesizedimnt anunas  sailable solution  i contend that in most cases huminans  their activities  and the environment itself change over time   the time of the day as well as a more epochal sense of time  consequently the analysis of any prob  lem involving more than artificially limited aspects of our being cannot be complete  nor can it be free of ambiguities and tensions  in analyz  ing the problem  we cannot know all of the bits  nor can we be sure of the unassailability of the bits or of our analytical structure  neither can we be sure of our lheuristics of synthesis  if we take the problem solving approach  we certainly cannot do this haphazardly  but if we go through that process conscientiously we will never succeed in even stating the problem  let alone solving it  but since the environment will still have to be manipulated  certain aspects of the problem solving system will be irrationally slurred over in the interest of achieving some result  not only does this reintroduce irrationality  but the method is then built assumptions  personal hypotheses  and particulars developed in rela  tion to other hypotheses  the reciprocal relation of problem and form i have advocated is indeed quite different from the concepts of problem solving  in defense of the problem solving approach  however  one should acknowledge that the continuing development of feedback systems appears to be pro  viding models that more closely simulate the activity of architectural design  i only wish to express some reservation whether even a very refined feedback mechanism can compete with the human mind in such an improbable  controversial domain as that of environmental design for the facilitation of human purposes  thus  the call is not for artificially precise problems  rigorous sys  tems  friction less solutions  or justification of one s actions  growth of i architectural learning and practice rather calls for a relentless t ational       and sensible criticism that  worries  the problem  striving for a better f     problem   especially a better problem   and then also for a relation of problem and form that is resistant to criticism  along with our complex problems  we have complex techniques and many people with naive conjectures  we should be more systematic in recognizing these factors in setting up the conjectures  in criticizing them  and thereby learning and growing  but such an approach is not systematic in the sense of imposing a manageable structure  rather it seeks to discover the structure through an interesting situation of mul  tiple conjectures and criticism  since we don t know what the situation is until we are involved in              the process  it is no use later asking if we are saying what we meant  we learn through the process and therefore want to ask   do i mean what   am saying   in that paper of thirty six years ago  i was clearly exercised about  instru  mentalization   but resistance to instrumentalization  and even the form of my resistance is  i believe  still pertinent  in the paper i did not mention the other pole of hays  concern   autonomy   either as a response to the problem  solving position or as another position i sought to confront  nonetheless  autonomy was present in the setting  in 1964  peter eisenman  then a young professor at princeton  invited a group of young architects  plus two modestly elder ones  colin rowe and robert venturi  to spend a weekend in princeton discussing the state of archi  tecture and how they might collectively intervene  out of that meeting came an organization called conference of architects for the study of the environ  ment  case   among those who came to be involved  with their then affilia  tion  were eisenman  princeton  then new york   kenneth frampton  london  then princeton   michael graves  princeton   donlyn lyndon  university of oregon   richard meier  in practice in new york   henry millon  m it   gio pas  anella  jaquelin

 was ino formally rec ognized termination   coincided with the turbulence known asl9s68   that turbulence was recognizable in  the  results of  another project iiitiated by eisenman in 1966  the development of ideas for the urban tansformation of harlem culminating in the  new cities  exhibition at the museum of modern art at the beginning of 1967  four university based teams were involved  the architects just identified from columbia  rowe  thomas schumacher  jerry wells  and  fred koetter from corn  oraves and esenman from princeton  and anderson  millon  and robert goodman frqm m it 1  the work of none of the  new ci  teams  would illustrate  instrumental  ization   on the other hand  at leasty the cometi and princeton projects could be characterized as explorations toward an autonomous architecture  large portions of harlem were eliminated in favor of abstract  often handsome exer  cises in form and or figure ground  anipulation12 in contrast  the mtt proj  ect began with a series of developmental stages on the undeveloped islands in the east river and on filled land id e teast river itsel  early stages also involved infill housing to transform the environmental character of the exist  ing large social housing projects  only after years of thedevelopment of such new resources was the incremental upgrading of the harlem fabric contem  plated  within the membership of the case group  not so identified for the moma exhibit   a split appeared  a dominant position moving toward auton  omy versus one that saw architecture as an  enterprise that did  indeed  have its own discipline  but had also to subject itself to material   social  and politi  cal criticism 13 in 1969  together witi m it students  i orgainized an exhibition at mit s hayden gallery  the predecessor to the list galleq  titled  form and use in architecture   the title is enough to say that the thesis  of the exhibi  tion engaged the issues of the problem worrying essay  the closing event of the exhibition in early 1969 was only the second public event of case  14 it was also the demise of case  as most of the members saw the mit exhibition as supporting both  instrumentalization  and  more from the moma experience  naive spcial  causes such as  advocay iplanning   incontra t  o neishould think of these as also the years in which peter eisenman embraced the autonomy of  cardboard architecture  and desighis ser es of numb d house projects 15 i consider the mit contribution  in both these exhibitions to have been exercises in  problem worrying   within this approach  there was an effort to recognize the internal demands of the discipline of architecture as well as the  problem   the architectural example within the problem worrying paper was  after all  of le corbusier s carpenter center  the  form and use  exhibition featured  a section devoted to de stirchitecture and design  i riluding mate  rials on loan from truus schroder schrader whose famous house in utrecht  1924   by mrs  schrdder and ierrittieetveld  is often taken as x e apotheosis of abstract form translated into architectural space  in the leaflet that accom  panied the exhibition  i discussed the house somewhat differently  while le corbusier apoke of maa and the play of primary forms in light  the dutch artista and architects of the de stij group undertook the exploration of form in a quite different manner  rher than peaking mawand platonic formd  they attacked the problem of design armed with what they conaidered thefundamental elements of

henryva nade veldel  in the schroder house  spatial  and utilitarian concerns are imbedded  in the development of the de stijl formal system  direct experience of the schr6der house reveals the intellectual  formal principles that concerned the de stijl g bup  it is the embodim nt of aset of ideas in substantial form  how  ever  unlike buildings that embody a formal idea in whole  object like volumes  the de stijl forms of the schroder house were generated additively  in this way the perceptual experience of the house and the demands of use contribute to the construction of the whole that is consistent with the formal intent but not wholly preconceived  visiting the house  one becomes aware of the formal system behind the design  and simultaneously aware of the use implications of the formal organization  even though the de stijl group consciously suppressed the nature of materials  they do stand as one of the few exemplars of a solution to the form  use pioblem  de stijl objects and environments attest to the possibility of con  ventions accommodating  even encouraging  patterns of use that are convinc  ing in both intellectual and utilitarian terms 16 within the concept of quasi autonomy there is a wide range of contribu  tive work  some approach autonomy while others are deeply engaged in the material and social conditions of the environment  i saw eisenman s early work  notably the toy museumin princeton  in the same light that i sought to cast on the schroder house  the de stijil and early eisenman works are of fundamental importance to the discipline of architecture  they project new ways of conceiving material form  space  light  and  at least to my mind  impli  cations for use and meaning  significantly  these  new ways  are deployed in such a manner as to give as much or more attention to their generalized poten  tials as to the specifics they initially served  it is in this that they approach autonomy and establish new references within the discipline  one reason that works such as these by the de stijl group and eisenman remain within the domain of quasi autonomy is their intimate scale  also  a particular use is not defined  one is acutely aware of one s own body in  and in relation to  these environments   and with this  also the anticipation of one s occupation in vanious modes   pure geometric forms  or even conventional ar hitectural mfoms inflated to grandiose proportions   as one may see in the so called reolutionary archite ts of the late eighteenth century   cross anoter sholdhehrt    es h th e  thee autonomy of architecture  we arrive at an aut no th t dsrve  s pc e in our conceptualization of architec  ture  but less assuredly belongs in our built environment  i say only  less assuredly  f we might adopt adolf loos s position that architecture rarely ente  tae e  alm of art   perhaps only in confronting death 17 so there may be place f a gigantic cenotaph for newton  but  despite itssize  ths isd ainfinitesimal part of what we want or need in our envi   o n me    i   l i   al  an ie oe ur  envi  ronment  even very clever arc hitctso not conceive transfbrmational formal 36   anderson systems every time they pick up a pencil or mouse  rather  it is also a high call  ing to comprehend the formal systems available within the discipline of archi  tecture and then to bring these to bear fruitfully on our environmental needs and the materiality of building  indeed  it is this broader task that could yield the larger architectural and urban environments in which we would choose to live  when we broaden our focus in this way  less austere inventions also emerge as significant contributions to the discipline of architecture  in le corbusier s renowned five points  modern material and processes of construc  tion are imbedded within the disciplinary proposition  despite this complic  ity in material and time  the five points also opened significant general propo  sitions about space  light  and environmental organization  the five points are as much or more a contribution to the discipline of architecture as are the concepts of de stijl  but it is also the case that the five points could not have been conceived without the availability of reinforced concrete  there really is no technological invention in the five points  they are rather a significant archi  tectural discovery within a recently available technology  8 stated thus  le cor  busier s achievement invites the comment  j         b  1              i  linary inventions  but personal experience of the arti  facts shows that they too are discoveries of space  light  and organization  as in the example of the five points  the notion of quasi autonomy is not limited to flights of high architecture and theory  indeed  i have explored the concept in relation to city form  savannah 20 and workers  housing  krupp at essen and the gutehofnunshuitte at eisenheim  2  as may be seen then  there is a significant range within the concept of quasi autonomy  some instances approach the austere  they provide those spe  cial  rare explorations within the discipline of architecture exemplified by de stijl  of course  the formation of the de stijl group and its set of concerns can be convincingly explored within a particular historical setting  but its ele  mental propositions in matters of visual form do indeed have a high degree of autonomy  whether in mondrian s paintings  rietveld s furniture  or the schroder house  we recognize a physical tour de force to exemplify those ele  mental principles   and yet our minds can entertain the quite different levels at which we are addressed  the tactile qualities of mondrian s paintings do not destroy their ideality  i think it is for the same reasons that  when we see a de stijl work  we do think of holland circa 1920  but can also grant these prin  iciples a generality that is not tied to that moment alone  i even these special cases become instances within a universal notion of quasi autonomy  eventually they are tested and  if fortunate  given greater house i  toy museum   princeton  new jersey  peter eisenman  interior  mining autonomy   37 effect by their performance  in speaking of a  universal notion   i claim that every environmental work  and other forms of human invention  participates in quasi autonomous relationships  nevertheless  this claim for generality does not give a meaningless whitewash to all works  we can make critical dis  tinctions  unlike the de stijl example  le corbusier s five points participates quite directly in the material world  in contrast to the de stijl case  there can be a relatively seamless relation between the disciplinary potentials espoused in the five points and a built work based on those principles  but for the same reason  the five points reveal a  valued  potential within certain material con  ditions  less general  more technically appropriate  than the de stijl example  more technically and historically constrained than le corbusier acknowledged  even a banal work can be analyzed in term of quasi autonomy but will be revealed as just that  banal  my own efforts at using the argument of quasi  autonomy to reveal a powerful example   and allow this to serve as a gauge of comparative works   is perhaps best demonstrated in my studies of the town plan of savannah 22 it is not special that one can analyze savannah from the perspective of quasi autonomy  it is the distinctive features and the historical performance of savannah  revealed through an analysis of its quasi autonomy  that make it special and indeed a comparative test for other city plans  finally  i want to recognize that the notion of quasi autonomy is in no way limited to architecture or matters of the physical environment  conven  tions  whether touching on social or environmental issues  and  after all  these can never be wholly separate   can be examined in terms of their quasi auton  omous relations  an illustrative example is the social category of  teenager   the concept is so imbedded in our society that at first it seems the years from thirteen to nineteen must have some unity that is in turn characterized by some inevitable traits  there are always and everywhere people of these teen years  and they surely have traits that are different from those who are either younger or older  what we make of this population  however  is at least as much or more a matter of the social construct we make for them  and they for themselves  this is my simple advocacy  the fruitfulness of recognizing the strengths and the claims of  on one side  our theories and conventions  that should not be held dogmatically  and  on the other  the realities  that are in some ways obdurate but often remarkably and fascinatingly malleable  to seek to live only a life of the mind at one pole  or of materiality at the other  or of coercive power from either  is to impoverish one s self  one s discipline  and one s smaller or greater community  notes 1 the essay had its initial form in a lecture for the conference  conventions  canons  and criticism   organized by the author for mit and held at the american academy of arts and sciences in cambridge  april 1982  2 actually i wrote  semi autonomy   i now prefer  quasi auton  omy   so i use that form throughout this essay  even where it involves changing an earlier text  3 on a different critical front  this was also the year of robert venturi s complexity and contradiction in architecture  new york  museum of modern art  1966   4 as noted  this is an unpublished essay first presented at the architectural association  london  in march 1966  it was repeated on 5 june 1966 at the annual teachers  confer  ence of the association of collegiate schools of architec  ture  meeting at the cranbrook academy in bloomfield hills  michigan  as produced here  the text is changed in minor matters of felicity  the elimination of such usage of the time as  the architect     he    and abbreviation in accord with the current editors  5 in fact i was happy to pre judge the princeton project and won the resources to stage an mit conference  inventing the future environment   1966  that explored other views of the situation of architecture and planning  the resulting book was s  anderson  ed   planning for

modern art  see the new city  architecture and urban renewal  new york  moma  1967   12  an interesting outgrowth of the exhibition has been the establishment  in new york city  of the institute for archi  tecture and urban studies  through the joint efforts of the museum of modern art and cornell university  the insti  tute will combine university  museum  and governmental resources as they may be brought to bear on what is now one of the most pressing questions of our time  what is to become of our cities   arthur drexler was a motivating force in this foundation  colin rowe played a role in the affiliation of cornell university  but the quoted paragraph gives no indication of the central role  once again  of peter eisenman first in the foundation of iaus and then as its leader  with rowe as a sidekick in the first years   a major project of the institute was one on streets sponsored by the u s  department of housing and urban development  1970 1972   it resulted in a housing

time in the political and social criticism of the architectural pro  fession  millon and i were more inclined to sustain disciplin  ary inquiry while sharing in goodman s concerns  from the beginning of the project there was a bond to withdraw col  lectively if moma resisted the politicization of our project  a possibility that was always at hand and perhaps restrained only by the intense general politics of the time and notably in matters concerning harlem  perhaps it is of anecdotal interest that michael dukakis drew up the agm partnership papers  on the politics of architecture and planning of that moment  see  robert goodman  after the planners  new york  simon   schuster  1971   14 case meetings were private to the members and guests except for a public event at the university of

enterprise  in the  architettura razionale  exhibition at the milan triennale of 1973  eisenman anticipated an achievement in architecture  belatedly  of what the  modernist sensi  bility  had properly been  a new  non humanist cultural attitude  i believe there can be important distinctions between vulgar zeitgeist arguments and the invocation  offered by eisenman  of an episteme as conceived by foucault  what those distinctions would be  and how they relate to eisenman s continuing work cannot be attempted here  16 s  anderson   form and use in architecture   photocopy leaflet
